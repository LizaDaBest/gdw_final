Title: Super Duper Wuper Idle Game
Genre: Idle Game
Description: See how fast you can reach the maximum money you can make, as the princess does like her coins, but you...not quite yet. Race against your buddies and time yourselves to try to beat your own high scores.â€‹ (not very super duper wuper, but certainly a faint attempt at being wuper.) Created for GDW at Fitchburg State University for my final solo game project.

Total Hours Spent: 29

Basic Goals:
Basic set of buttons that function when clicked with mouse (UI) (done)
A coin counter that goes up and decreases when something is bought (UI) (done)
Equations for coin counter that changes when upgrades are made (done)
Get upgrade buttons implemented (done)
Get menu buttons implemented (done)
A falling coin object that falls randomly across screen to be clicked with mouse to get extra coins that add to the counter (done)
Final characters + environment art (princess and final boss sprites most likely not needed for this project timeframe) (done)
Hero and enemy character scripts
Figure out how to make small animations work (jumping/hitting effect, etc.)
A menu (that does not pause the game) that has sound effect, music, and brightness sliders
Figure out if there is a way to implement the game collecting passively without being open (not required to have in the end)
Figure out if there is a way to save game data even when closing game (not required to have in the end)
Make scenes generally more pretty
Implement a mini cutscene in the beginning/end (only if I have the time, not necessary)

LOG:

Day 1 (4 hours):
4 hours - coding/UI
Created simple title, options, and game scene for code testing purposes which includes basic UI elements (a button, coin counter, player placeholder, and enemy placeholder)
Spent a lot of time having trouble with UI not showing on Main Camera, but eventually figured it out
Need to figure out how to code specific buttons to change scenes - jeff
Need to figure out the coin counter to gain coins passively - jeff

Day 2 (6 hours):
6 hours - art
Drew up sketches, line art, and simple coloring for the basic hero, enemy, and princess sprites

Day 3 (3 hours)
3 hours - in-class workshop
Got passive coin counter working (thanks Jeff)
Figured out how to get start (thanks jeff) and exit buttons working (test when a build is made, cannot test it now)
Need to find out why options menu background turns another color when clicked
Created sketch for environment art
Need to get clickable coins working
Need to get basic hero and enemy characters imported to start their scripts
Need to add a timer to coins if not clicked for a while

Day 4 (4 hours)
3 hours - in-class workshop
Fixed character image files to be transparent, imported into scene
Imported background art sketch to scene to test placement
Struggled with jeff to try to get clickable coin working (failed)
Worked on environment for a little after frustration with coin
Need to create hero script where if hero dies, enemy lineup resets
Need to create enemy script where if enemy dies, next enemy spawns (not infinite)

Worked through falling clickable coin mechanic

Day 5 (3 hours)
3 hours - programming
Polished the falling clickable coins

Day 6 (9 hours)
Created itch.io page for game
Made code for enemy damage slider, superhit button, and enemy respawn
Imported finished environment art into title screen and main game scenes
Had it looked over and was told that it was too large of a scope (advanced programming that I cannot do in this timeframe)
Literally had a mental breakdown
Simplified gameplay into simple buttons that increase coin multipliers to get more coins
Added original princess asset just to include it for visual purposes
Build game for WebGL, Windows, Mac, and Linux Build
